# Conquer
Convolution Smoothed Quantile Regression

## Description

This package applies a convolution-based smoothing approach to fit linear quantile regression models. This method, which we refer to as conquer,
turns the non-differentiable check loss into a twice-differentiable, convex and locally strongly convex surrogate, which admits a fast and scalable Barzilai-Borwein gradient-based algorithm to perform optimization, and multiplier bootstrap for statistical inference.
