# Conquer
This package (in python) applies a convolution smoothing approach to fit linear quantile regression models. We refer this method as conquer. Normal-based and (multiplier) bootstrap confidence intervals for all slope coefficients are constructed. The Barzilai-Borwein gradient descent algorithm, initialized at a Huberized expectile regression estimate, is used to compute conquer estimators. This algorithm is scalable to very large-scale datasets.
